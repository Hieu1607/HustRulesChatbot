# HustRulesChatbot

HustRulesChatbot is a Python-based chatbot designed to answer questions related to school rules and policies. It uses semantic similarity to match user questions with predefined rules and leverages a generative AI model for questions not covered in the dataset.

## Project Structure

- **model.py**: Contains the main logic for loading rules, finding similar questions, generating answers using the Gemini AI model, and saving new rules.
- **rules.json**: A JSON file containing predefined questions and answers about school rules and policies.
- **test.ipynb**: Reserved for testing and experimentation with the chatbot logic.

## Features

1. **Semantic Search**: Uses SentenceTransformer to find semantically similar questions in the `rules.json` file.
2. **Generative AI**: Integrates the Gemini AI model to generate answers for questions not found in the dataset.
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically saves new questions and their generated answers to `rules.json` for future use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `google-generativeai`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `torch`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install google-generativeai sentence-transformers torch
   ```
3. Replace the placeholder API key in `model.py` with your actual Gemini API key.

## Usage

1. Add your predefined rules to `rules.json` in the format:
   ```json
   [
       {
           "question": "Your question here?",
           "answer": "The corresponding answer here."
       }
   ]
   ```
2. Run the chatbot by executing `model.py`:
   ```sh
   python model.py
   ```
3. Input your question when prompted, and the chatbot will provide an answer.

## Example Questions

- "Học sinh có được mặc áo hoodie thay đồng phục không?"
- "Nếu tôi đi trễ thì sao?"
- "Có được ăn trong lớp không?"

## Notes

- Ensure `rules.json` is properly formatted to avoid errors.
- The chatbot dynamically updates `rules.json` with new questions and answers generated by the AI.
